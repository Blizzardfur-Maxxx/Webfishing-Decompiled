# Webfishing — Godot Decomp

A **recreated Godot project** for *Webfishing*.  
Lets you open the game in Godot to explore or mod it.

---

## Note
-Steam support is broken when when compiled im looking for help when fixing it rn you can probably use a steam emulator or Spacewar.
-Also i had to take some files from the gamejam version like the enviroment file becuse it erroered when i decompiled.
